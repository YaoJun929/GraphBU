# GraphBU: A Bottom-up Graph Neural Network for Expression Solving  
  Expression-solving seeks to find satisfactory solutions for a given expression within critical mathematical computation.Recent advancements in deep learning have showcased the efficacy of
sequence-to-sequence neural networks in simple expression-solving tasks.However, the inability of sequence methods to extract structural information from expressions limits the applicability in more
complex scenarios.Distinguished from strings, graphs serve as an efficient representation format for expressions, prompting researchers to explore graph-based methodologies for expression solving. Graphto-sequence methods have been proposed to enhance the computation of complex expressions. Nevertheless, many graph-based approaches fail to adequately address the spatial computational relationships between nodes and their neighbors within expressions.To
effectively utilize graph information, this paper introduces a novel bottom-up graph neural network that efficiently extracts structural information from expression graphs. Rigorously evaluated across three
mathematical tasks and four baseline experimental scenarios, the results confirm that our method excels at uncovering hidden structural  information and advancing mathematical reasoning.
